# Walmart Sales Analysis – Data Analytics Case Study

A portfolio project inspired by a case study by Data & Analytics Educator Mary Knoeferl.

 ## Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart Retail Sales to uncover the key factors influencing weekly sales across different stores.
Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored trends, correlations, and patterns such as:

#### Store performance

#### Holiday impact

#### Fuel prices

#### CPI (Consumer Price Index)

#### Temperature

#### Unemployment rates


## Business Questions

This project answers critical questions, including:

#### How do holidays affect weekly sales?
#### Which stores in the dataset have the lowest and highest unemployment rate?
#### Is there any correlation between CPI and Weekly Sales?  How does the correlation differ when the Holiday Flag is 0 versus when the Holiday Flag is 1?
#### Why do you think Fuel Price is included in this dataset?  What conclusions can be made about Fuel Price compared to any of the other fields?

### Tools & Technologies

#### Python
 pandas
